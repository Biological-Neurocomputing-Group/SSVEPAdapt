# SSVEPAdapt
Open source software platform to control LED stimulation, brain signal detection and user adaptation with the best parameters.

For the LED stimulation it is used through the graphical user interface GUI and you could control parameters of the LED stimulation sending internally commands to Arduino.
For the brain signals, Canonical Correlation Analysis is implemented to detect SSVEP signals.
For the user adaptation the platform allows you to find the best frequencies, phases and electrodes for each user.
